### CS128L - Term Project

This repository will serve as the host for any further code changes. Let's keep it tidy.
Refer to the __Project.doc__ for the requirements of this system.

Please observe *proper naming conventions.*

For __branches__ , use *Surname*-edits. if you plan on making another sub-branch, name it with
something relevant like diag-form for the changes regarding the _diagnosis_ form

Also do the same thing for the Visual C# Elements:

Labels->__lbl__ 

TextBoxes->__tbx__ 

Forms->__frm__

Buttons->__btn__
 
and so on, doing so will help all of us code faster and with much ease using IntelliSense.

NOTE: a user and password is required for the login form, use:

*admin*
