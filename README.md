CS128L - Term Project

This repository will serve as the host for any further code changes. Let's keep it tidy.
Refer to the Project.doc for the requirements of this system.

Please observe proper naming conventions.
For branches, use *Surname*-edits. if you plan on making another sub-branch, name it with
something relevant like diag-form for the changes regarding the diagnosis form

Also do the same thing for the Visual C# Elements:

Labels 		lbl
TextBoxes	tbx
Forms		frm
Buttons 	btn
 
and so on...

doing so will help all of us code faster and with much ease using IntelliSense.

NOTE: a user and password is required for the login form, use:

admin
